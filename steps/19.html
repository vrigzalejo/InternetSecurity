<p class="text-justify">Some online sites offer customers the ability to use a six-digit code which randomly changes every 30â€“60 seconds on a security token. The keys on the security token have built in mathematical computations and manipulate numbers based on the current time built into the device. This means that every thirty seconds there is only a certain array of numbers possible which would be correct to validate access to the online account.</p>
