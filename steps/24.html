<h3 class="slide-top-title">Message Authentication Code (MAC)</h3>
<p class="text-justify">A Message authentication code (MAC) is a cryptography method that uses a secret key to encrypt a message. This method outputs a MAC value that can be decrypted by the receiver, using the same secret key used by the sender. The Message Authentication Code protects both a message's data integrity as well as its authenticity.</p>
