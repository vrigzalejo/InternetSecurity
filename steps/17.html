<h3 class="slide-top-title">Electronic mail security</h3>
<p class="text-justify">Email messages are composed, delivered, and stored in a multiple step process, which starts with the message's composition. When the user finishes composing the message and sends it, the message is transformed into a standard format: an <b>RFC 2822</b> formatted message. Afterwards, the message can be transmitted. Using a network connection, the mail client, referred to as a <b>Mail User Agent (MUA)</b>, connects to a <b>Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)</b> operating on the mail server.</p>
