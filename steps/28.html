<h4 class="slide-sub-title">Role of firewalls in web security</h4>
<p class="text-justify">Firewalls impose restrictions on incoming and outgoing Network packets to and from private networks. Incoming or outgoing traffic must pass through the firewall; only authorized traffic is allowed to pass through it. Firewalls create checkpoints between an internal private network and the public Internet, also known as choke points(borrowed from the identical military term of a combat limiting geographical feature).
